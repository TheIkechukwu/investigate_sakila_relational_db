## Project goal
For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

## Project Rubric
* All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit JOINs. The JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to the query.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregations. This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation.
* At least 2 of the 4 SQL queries need to include either a subquery OR a CTE.
* At least 1 of the 4 queries should use a Window Function.
* The SQL queries are well formatted and use aliases.
